# Hello World Template - Node.js

# Welcome to Altostra
We have created this Hello World project for you to get the feel for our platform and to get you started with the next-gen of cloud development.

Follow the instructions below to get started.

Visit us at [www.altostra.com](https://www.altostra.com)

Happy Clouding!

# Before you begin
Before you dive into creating cool applications with Altostra, we need to set you up first. Follow these steps:

## 1. Create a free Altostra account
To create an account, simply login to the [Altostra Web Console](https://app.altostra.com).

## 2. Install the Altostra CLI
You will use the [Altostra CLI](https://docs.altostra.com/reference/CLI/altostra-cli.html) for many of the management operations.

Install it from NPM (make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed):

```sh
# make sure you have Node.js 10 or above installed
$ npm i -g @altostra/cli
```

## 3. Install Altostra Tools for Visual Studio Code
Altostra Tools for Visual Studio Code integrates Altostra's visual designer and utilities into Visual Studio Code, which enables you to work on your application infrastructure side-by-side with your code.

Install it from the terminal:
```sh
$ code --install-extension Altostra.altostra
```

or, search for `Altostra Tools` in the Visual Studio Code extensions view.

or, directly from the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Altostra.altostra).

## 4. Login from the CLI
Run the following command to login:

```sh
$ alto login
```

Many of the commands below require you to login first.

# Open, explore and edit the project
Open the project directory in Visual Studio Code, the Altostra Designer will load automatically.

# Deploy to the cloud

## Before you proceed
For the this part, you must first [connect a cloud account](https://docs.altostra.com/getting-started/connect-your-accounts.html#connect-your-cloud-service-accounts) in the [Web Console](https://app.altostra.com/settings). 

When you connect your first cloud account, Altostra creates a new `Production` environment for you – when you deploy to this environment resources are created on your connected account.

## Deploy
Create an [image](https://docs.altostra.com/reference/concepts/project-image.html) and a [deployment](https://docs.altostra.com/reference/concepts/deployments.html).

```sh
# create a new image "v1.0" for the project
$ alto push v1.0

# deploy the image "v1.0" to a new deployment in the "Production" environment
$ alto deploy prod:v1.0 --new Production
```

## Explore the deployment details
You can now open the Altostra Web Console to browse your project and its deployments:

```sh
# open the current project in the Altostra Web Console 
$ alto console
```

**Click** on the deployment name `prod` in the list to open the deplyment profile page.  

Under "Deployments History" you should see a single entry with the details of your deployment and the current status. The deployment might take a while to complete.

**Click** on the action link on the right side of the history entry to open the cloud provider's console where you can see the deployed resources and their details.

## Update
If you decide to change the design or the code of the project, you will need to upload a new version.

To do that, push a new image and [update the deployment](https://docs.altostra.com/howto/projects/deploy-project.html#update-an-existing-deployment):
```sh
# create a new image "v1.1" for the project
$ alto push v1.1

# update the existing "prod" deployment with the new "v1.1" image
$ alto deploy prod:v1.1
```

> You don't need to specify the `--new` option and the environment name when you update deployments.

# Test locally
You can run the project locally to try it out and play around with the code. It's a good way to debug, test and quickly iterate during development—make sure to also properly test your projects in the cloud.

## Before you proceed
To run the project locally, make sure you have these tools installed:

1. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)

## Start the API
To start a local instance of the API, run:
```sh
# builds the project and saves the resulting SAM template to a file
$ alto build

# start an instance of API Gateway on the localhost
$ sam local start-api -t sam-template.json
```

> If you change the project design, re-run these commands.

## Get the message
Run the following command to get the welcome message:
```sh
$ curl http://localhost:3000/welcome-message 
```

## Set your name
Run the following command to set your name:
```sh
$ curl --data "Your Name Here" http://localhost:3000/my-name
```

Now run the previous command to get the message again, it should now be personalized 👋🏻
